	<pre class="writing">	Hi. It’s been so long since I wrote something in
	this document. I want to try writing daily but I always get
	distracted and don't get time for it. I am now trying to to 
	complete my notes as latest as possible because I am bad at 
	writing notes in school. I suck at writing school notes since 
	3rd or 2nd grade or something. I want write fast I think. There 
	was a lot of rain today compared to other days. It looks good 
	outside. Today there was a PTA meeting at school. It wasn't 
	compulsory for students to come to school that today but I had 
	to go because I was also in the prayer song of the programme. 
	After the programme, My mom and I went to the restaurant and ate food, 
	went to home by bus (because the scooty wasn't staring(maybe a battery issue)),
	and now I am writing this in 06:08 pm and going to workout in 06:30 pm. 
	After then, I will write my workbook for Sunday school, Eat food and sleep 
	(I will bath in morning). I still read that Sherlock Holmes book to get sleepy 
	(To get fast sleep). I forgot to mention the date. Today is 13th of July 2024.
	That’s it. See you next time.</pre>
