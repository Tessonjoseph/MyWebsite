	<hr>
	<pre class="writing">	My name is Tesson. Now I am 14 years old, studying in 9th grade.
	Now I am writing this in 27th June of 2024.
	
	
	My 8th grade year was a mess. I was a lot into social media addiction that time.
	I am just in a brain fog, I can't make words in time.
	I forget some things even though they just got remembered.
	I forget the names of most of the people.
	8th grade was a ruin for me.
	
	
	Now in 9th grade, I decided to stop this.
	I stepped across this YouTube channel called 'jvscholz' and
	I like the way he reduces his time into social media.
	I like the way he utilises his time for other better things.
	Before watching that channel i thought that social 
	media have nothing to do with my brain-fog.
	
	
	Today morning I woke up at 6:15am, brushed my teeth, drank a glass of water, and 
	even did a home workout before writing this
	and didn't open Instagram in between.
	I prepared a small book for my desk to just writing some ideas.
	A LAN phone but I can't call on it because I don't have a LAN connection.
	But I use it for alarms and it works great. But I stopped using it
	because it wastes a plug of my extension board for just 
	alarms. I set my PC to monochrome mode so that I don't get over-focused in it.
	And it worked.
	And I set up a launcher called 'Before Launcher' For my phone so that i can get 
        less screen time on my phone.
	It also worked.
	That's it.
	I am now signing off.</pre>
