	<hr>
	<pre class="writing">	My name is Tesson Joseph. And I was born in a Gen Z Era.
	I had fun during my childhood until the pandemic came out.
	I was locked indoors and never got a way to get outside and touch grass.
	I don’t know why but I am now typing slower than usual and keep making mistakes
	often. I mean I had a lot of time to play with my Mum's ‘smart’ 
	phone without realising that I was being more 'dumb'.
	I had scored 100% at my 2nd grade but that was 7 years ago.
	After pandemic, I was only scoring about 67% or even 53%. Until 3-4 months,
	I still thought that the internet or smartphone wasn’t the cause of this 
	much bad grades. I really want to score better grades at school. This is my 9th 
	grade. I want to score better this year. Oh, I forgot that this was the
	‘About Myself’ thing. I can’t say much because the social media has erased most 
	of my good qualities and made me a ‘dumb’ guy.
	Even at the 9th grade, I still fear to talk to someone openly, hiding my real 
	personality. Most of the things are ruined.
	Now, I want to restore all the good things from my childhood.
	That’s why I started coding, so that I wont be scrolling.
	And that’s why this webpage existed. That’s all for now. I may update this page
	soon.
	I’m now signing off.</pre>
